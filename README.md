# `<address>`

### What does `<address>` do?
`<address>` should be used for addresses. You guessed that already. But what kind of addresses, and in what context?

Address context
`<address>` was originally used to indicate contact information for the page owner. It has since evolved to include any type of contact information, generally the address of an article author or the address of a website.

- üîπ If `<address>` is placed within an `<article>`, it is assumed this is the article author's address.

- üî∏ If `<address>` is placed closest to the `<body>` tag, it's assumed to be the website organization's address. Usually this type of information is found in a page `<header>` or   `<footer>`.

### Kinds of addresses

‚úÖ Any information that's used to contact the website organization or the article author is fair game. That might include:

- email addresses

- social media links

- phone numbers

The contact person's name may also be included in an address element.

‚õîÔ∏è However, non-contact information is to be avoided.


# `<blockquote>` and `<q>`

`<blockquote>` is for block-level quotes, while `<q>` is used for inline quotes. Optionally, these may be paired with either a <cite> element or a cite attribute. (We'll cover <cite> and cite tomorrow, Day 3.)

In other words, a longer quote goes in a `<blockquote>` element, while `<q>` marks shorter passages.

üëÄ Sounds easy, but it's not as straightforward as you think.

### When to use `<blockquote>`
- ‚úÖ You're quoting an extended passage from a book, article, website, or some other work. By making this passage stand alone, it's clear that this is something you are quoting, not something that you originally wrote.

- ‚úÖ You're quoting what someone said as a report, not as a conversation.

- ‚úÖ Somewhere, there's a citation that could go with this.

### When to use `<q>`
üèÅ You're quoting a short passage from a book, article, website, or another work. Typically this is a few words or a line or two. Anything longer should probably use `<blockquote>`.

üèÅ It's not a conversation.

üèÅ There's a citation that could go with it.

### When not to use `<blockquote>` or `<q>`
- ‚õîÔ∏è Dialog - if it's a conversation, it's not a quote.

- ‚õîÔ∏è Sarcasm or "air quotes" - there is a double quote key on your keyboard for these. It's not just for "code."

‚ùå ‚ùå ‚ùå PLEASE do not use `<blockquote>` for indents. CSS is made for indents. Use it.

- ‚õîÔ∏è Likewise, do not use `<q>` in particular for conversations. It has built-in curly quotes before and after your quotation. They're pretty and tempting. But they are not for your conversation.

- ‚õîÔ∏è Did I mention that `<q>` is not for conversations?

### Common attributes
üëÄ `<cite>` and the cite attribute are commonly associated with these elements, for obvious reasons. Your original thoughts or writing are not included in `<blockquote>` and `<q>`. Therefore, a citation is appropriate. (We'll cover `<cite>` and cite tomorrow, Day 3.)


# `<cite>`

`<cite>` is for the title of a work, which can be quoted, referenced in detail, or mentioned in passing. "Works" are books, songs, paintings, programs, TV shows, operas, social media posts, and so much more. If you're referring to something that's not your own, you need to cite it in some way.

How hard could this be? So hard. WHATWG and MDN don't agree on many points, leaving we poor developers in a world of hurt. Let's start where they do agree.

### Titles of works
If it's a creative work, like the title of a book, movie, or exhibition, or the name of an opera, painting, or TV show, use `<cite>` to indicate it as such.

    <p>Baby Yoda in <cite>The Mandalorian</cite> is the cutest thing ever!</p> 

üéì So... not exactly an academic citation, is it? We aren't linking to Disney+, or a website, or any study that has conclusively proved this statement to be true, even though we know it is true.

### Where it gets hard
Let's say we want to properly quote this:

- Who said it: The Client

- TV show: *The Mandalorian*

- Quote: "**Bounty hunting is a complicated profession.**"

- Website source: https://www.starwars.com/news/the-mandalorian-quotes

It's a short quote, so it could be inside of a `<q>` element as part of a sentence, or it could be set off as a more prominent quote in a `<blockquote>` element. Let's demonstrate the `<blockquote>` variation according to WHATWG and MDN.

### WHATWG Example 1
    <blockquote cite="https://www.starwars.com/news/the-mandalorian-quotes">  
       <p>Bounty hunting is a complicated profession.</p> </blockquote> 
    <p>The Client in <cite>The Mandalorian</cite></p> 
WHATWG maintains that the citation should not show up inside of the `<blockquote>`. It should be placed after it. The URL citation is placed as an attribute to `<blockquote>` to associate the URL with the quote.

### WHATWG Example 2
    <figure>
       <blockquote cite="https://www.starwars.com/news/the-mandalorian-quotes">
         <p>Bounty hunting is a complicated profession.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <figcaption>The Client in <cite>The Mandalorian</cite></figcaption> 
    </figure> 
This methodology associates the quote with who said it from where more strongly. (We'll talk about `<figure>` as part of the Multimedia Extravaganza toward the end of this month.)

By the way, if you feel like both of these examples make no sense, we sympathize. We are reporting their rules, not our agreement with them.

### MDN Example
    <blockquote>
       <p>Bounty hunting is a complicated profession.</p>
       <footer>The Client in <cite><a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/the-mandalorian-quotes">The Mandalorian</a></cite></footer> 
    </blockquote> 
This might be closer to what you've seen others do before. Here the character who said it and the creative work are referenced inside the `<blockquote>`. The URL is in a clickable link, although it could be referenced via the cite attribute if a clickable link was not desired for some reason.

### Common attributes
Cite may also be an attribute within:

`<blockquote>` and `<q>` (discussed in Day 2)

`<del>` and `<ins>` (discussed in Day 12)

The value for the cite attribute is only a URL reference. It's not flexible about its content as the `<cite>` element is.

The cite attribute, when paired with `<blockquote>` or `<q>`, is particularly important when used with the WHATWG methodology of quoting, where the person who said it or the work are not included within the `<blockquote>` or `<q>` element. The *cite* attribute would therefore connect the URL reference to the thing that was said, since no other method is possible with their rules.

But again, we are open to instruction from anyone who can explain this more clearly than we can.

# `<dfn>`

`<dfn>` is used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence.

That means we'll look to the nearest or surrounding `<p>`, `<dd>` within a definition list (tomorrow!), or `<section>` element (Day 18) for the definition of the term.

### Ways to use `<dfn>`
The most obvious usage is to indicate the term being described within the context of the phrase or sentence. Here, "Godzilla" is defined by the rest of the paragraph.

    <p>My son thinks he is <dfn>Godzilla</dfn>, who is generally depicted as an enormous, violent, prehistoric sea monster awakened and empowered by nuclear radiation. It's true, there are similarities.</p> 

If we mention the definition again later in our content, we can add a bookmark link to jump back to the term nearest to the definition.

    <p>He is not as enamored with <dfn id="kong">King Kong</dfn> who resembles an enormous gorilla-like ape that has appeared in various media since 1933. </p> 
    
    ...
    
    <p>Complaints about <a href="#kong">Kong</a> include how he has no atomic fire breath.</p> 
One common -- and useful -- combination is to pair `<dfn>` with `<abbr>` (the abbreviation tag, appearing in an email near you on day 7) in order to define a term along with an acronym.

    <p><dfn><abbr title="Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism">MUTO</abbr></dfn> refers to a species of giant monsters that first appeared in <cite>Godzilla</cite> (2014) and <cite>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</cite> (2019). In <cite>Godzilla vs. Kong</cite> (2021), the enemy has changed.</p> 

### Little known facts about `<dfn>`
Both MDN and WHATWG say that if `<dfn>` has a title attribute, the attribute MUST contain only the term and no other text. Our thought is that this could be for a nickname, rather than an abbreviation, otherwise, it's unclear in the documentation what the difference is!

    <p>In the Godzilla-verse, <dfn title="Ghidorah">Monster Zero</dfn> is a giant extraterrestrial three-headed dragon-like monster.</p> 
If you are using a `<dl>` (Day 5, tomorrow!) as a DEFINITION list, then it's acceptable and perhaps even desirable to double tag the term with `<dfn>`. (Spoiler alert: `<dl>` may also be a description list!)

    <dl>
       <dt><dfn>Monster Island</dfn></dt>
       <dd>Island where Godzilla lives</dd>
       <dt><dfn>Skull Island</dfn></dt>
       <dd>Island where Kong lives</dd>
    </dl>
### Common attributes
Common attributes include *title* and *id*, as explained earlier.

# Description lists and `<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`

Today we focus on the three elements that make up a description list, historically called the definition list: `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>`.

While ordered `<ol>` and unordered `<ul>` lists are made of a series of **single items**, a description list has **pairs of information**. If there is a RELATIONSHIP between the term and the details, then you can technically use a description list.

The meaning of each tag is as follows:

- `<dl>` description list (or definition list)
- `<dt>` description name (or definition term)
- `<dd>` description details (or definition)

(*The above would be best marked up with a definition list. Unfortunately, we cannot access the Substack code to make it so. Yep, we‚Äôre as guilty of bad markup as anyone else.*)

Typically, a description list might be used with many types of information:

- üìö Author and book title(s)
- üì∑ Location and photographer
- üï∏ Website and description
- üé™ Date and event
- ‚ùì(Frequently Asked) Question and answer

You might also use it for some specific metadata at the start of an article or a recipe.

### Examples of a description list
A more general use is as a description list. Here we have two stores and things to purchase at each one:

    <dl>
       <dt>Target</dt>
         <dd>dish soap</dd>
         <dd>socks</dd>
       <dt>Fresh Thyme</dt>
         <dd>coconut water</dd>
         <dd>strawberries</dd>
         <dd>aged gouda</dd>
    </dl> 

The classic use as a definition list consisting of terms and definitions still works. It's lovely. Don't forget to include the <dfn> tag as appropriate!:

    <dl>
       <dt><dfn>Target</dfn></dt>
       <dd>Chain of stores selling clothing, electronics, health supplies and general household items</dd>
       <dt><dfn>Fresh Thyme</dfn></dt>
       <dd>A Midwestern grocery store chain in the United States</dd> 
    </dl> 
### Duplicating terms and descriptions
As shown above, you may have more than one `<dt>` for a `<dd>`, and you may have more than one `<dd>` for a `<dt>`.

If you have multiple `<dt>` elements in a row, it's assumed these are all names for the same thing.

If you have multiple `<dd>` elements in a row, it's assumed these are all possible descriptions for the term(s) immediately preceding the description.


### Little known fact about description lists
WHATWG is permitting `<div>` elements inside of `<dl>` now for two purposes: styling and for holding microdata elements.

    <h3>Grandma's Apple Pie</h3>
     <dl>
       <div>
         <dt>Preparation time</dt>
         <dd>1 hour</dd>
       </div>
       <div>
         <dt>Baking time</dt>
         <dd>45 minutes</dd>
       </div>
       <div>
         <dt>Oven temperature</dt>
         <dd>350 degrees</dd>
       </div>
     </dl>

# `<details>` and `<summary>`

`<details>` is a wrapper for a `<summary>` sentence or term and its longer explanation that begins collapsed. By clicking on a triangle next to the summary, we reveal a longer explanation.

ü™ó It's the EASIEST WAY TO MAKE AN ACCORDION MENU! ü™ó

True, animation effects to smooth out the transition are not available, but in a pinch, we think you'll find you love this tag as much as we do! üíï

### Example
The details/summary combination is perfect for information similar to a definition list, but which might have a series of items that stand alone, rather than grouped in list format:

    <details>
       <summary>Reading the fine print</summary>
       <p>This is where we hide all of the secret terms and conditions. Your mileage may vary.</p> 
    </details> 
The `<summary>` element is optional. Without it, you'll get the default clickable text which says "details." The `<summary>` element must also be the first child of `<details>`. Include it as the very first thing inside the `<details>` element.

### Little known facts about `<details>` and `<summary>`
- ‚õîÔ∏è The details element is not appropriate for footnotes. Seems like it would be a great fit, but unfortunately, it's not. See WHATWG for more information.

- ‚õîÔ∏è There is currently no way to control the animation between the summary being hidden and revealed.

- ‚úÖ The `<summary>` element is used nowhere else in HTML. It may only be used with `<details>` and only as a first-child of `<details>`. How's that for a specific element?

### Common attributes
By including the open attribute in the `<details>` element, the element will appear open by default on the page, rather than closed:

    <details open>
       <summary>About My Life</summary>
       <p>My life is as open as this details panel.</p> </details> 
When a summary is opened, an open attribute is added to details. This attribute may be used to style each state. [The below example is from WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html#the-details-element):

    details > summary {
    transition: color 1s;
    color: black;  
    }
    details[open] > summary {
    color: red;  
    }

# `<abbr>`

**TLA: three-letter acronym.*

`<abbr>` is for abbreviations or acronyms. If you're using them in your writing, well, you should define them. Your teacher told you this in school, and we're telling you again for your HTML.

### How `<abbr>` works
A good web starts with well-written content. Erika and Jen speak English in the United States, and this is our bias in the below advice. Modify the below advice to fit with grammar rules and conventions for your language and country.

‚úÖ If you learned to write papers in the US, you know that the first time you use an acronym or abbreviation, you should define it, unless it's extremely well known.

    <p>We are excited to see where NASA takes us next, given their many successes on the Moon and Mars.</p> 
To a US-based audience, we are so familiar with NASA, we may not know exactly what NASA stands for (or care, to be honest). However, it is an acronym, and we can mark it up as such:

    <p>We are excited to see where <abbr>NASA</abbr> takes us next, given their many successes on the Moon and Mars.</p> 
Yeah, not super helpful. We already guessed it was an abbreviation or acronym of some kind, but we still don't know what it stands for.

‚úÖ If you want to communicate the words behind the NASA acronym, there are two possibilities. We like this methodology, which combines good English writing practices with HTML:

    <p>We are excited to see where the <dfn id="NASA">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</dfn> (<abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>) takes us next, given their many successes on the Moon and Mars.</p> 
See how we combine `<dfn>`, which defines the abbreviation, with `<abbr>`? The ID in `<dfn>` may be used to link to that definition later in the document. (See Day 4 for details.)

The title attribute in `<abbr>` also tells us what the NASA acronym means, but the meaning is hidden. You may have seen this show up as a dotted line in some browsers, with a tooltip that appears when one hovers over the link. That's nice, but now one must do some work to see what the abbreviation means, rather than reading it in the sentence. Also, what happens if you're on a device that doesn't hover? That situation is nicely addressed above through content and markup.

However, if you're working with an abbreviation or acronym that is well-known, and not many people might need help with knowing what this is, you may leave the definition in the title attribute for the `<abbr>` element.**

    <p>We are excited to see where <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> takes us next, given their many successes on the Moon and Mars.</p>  
***Many of Jen‚Äôs current and former students now hear her voice in their heads: ‚ÄúJust because you can doesn‚Äôt mean you should‚Ä¶‚Äù*

## Common misconceptions

### Deprecated `<acronym>` element
‚õîÔ∏è Older HTML specifications included a separate <acronym> element, which is now deprecated. While there is a difference between acronyms and abbreviations, developers aren't that picky about the *semantic* difference.

### Differences in display across browsers
‚õîÔ∏è Some of these older browsers (IE in particular) don't style `<abbr>` the same way that our favorite browsers do (a dotted underline plus tooltip). As always, check across browsers for consistency in styling.

### Don't go crazy with `<abbr>`
‚úÖ Even the specifications state that not every instance of an abbreviation or acronym requires an `<abbr>` tag. Consider that Dr. is an abbreviation for "doctor" - would you seriously mark that up every time it occurs in medical documentation? We think not. Apply `<abbr>` judiciously. Don't go bananas.

### Commonly used attributes
We described the title attribute in detail earlier:

    <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>
The title attribute, when associated with the `<abbr>` element, must contain the definition of the acronym or abbreviation and nothing else.

# `<small>`

Read the Fine Print. It's become an art form in American society. Legal disclaimers, copyright notices, terms and conditions, privacy notifications, and so much more. It's all of those sticky details that must be disclosed, but companies like to keep hidden.

Those disclaimers and details are printed in tiny type to minimize printing costs and discourage detailed reading. We can do the same on the web!

### A brief history of `<small>`
Back in the Dark Days Before CSS, `<small>` was used for... small text! As in, text that's not big. That was for the `<big>` element, of course.

‚õîÔ∏è Then we got wise, separated presentation from markup, and `<small>` was tossed in the great üò† *Dustbin of Frowned-Upon Elements* üò† for several years during HTML4 and XHTML 1.0.

‚úÖ HTML5 brought back `<small>` with its new meaning, while it deprecated `<big>`. In the new definition, `<small>` is the fine print. As [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small) says, copyright, legal text, and side-comments are all candidates for `<small>`.

### When to use `<small>`
‚úÖ If it's a brief passage of "fine print," as an exception to the rest of the page's content, `<small>` is a great choice.

    <p><small>&copy; 2021 by me. All rights reserved, baby.</small></p> 
‚õîÔ∏è If it's an extended passage of fine print, like the pages containing the full privacy policy, terms and conditions, or other disclaimers of use, don't repeat `<small>` over and over again. On those pages, the fine print is the focus of the page, not the exception to it.

‚úÖ `<small>` may also be used to indicate limitations on an offer.

    <p>Today only: $10 off your purchase! <small>must purchase $1000 or more</small></p> 
### Common misconceptions about `<small>`
‚õîÔ∏è WHATWG cautions against using `<small>` as the "opposite" of strongly emphasized (`<strong>`) or emphasized (`<em>`) text:

The small element does not "de-emphasize" or lower the importance of text emphasized by the em element or marked as important with the strong element. To mark text as not emphasized or important, simply do not mark it up with the em or strong elements respectively.

üëÄ‚ö†Ô∏è Finally, always ask yourself if you're using `<small>` for styling or if you're using it to convey specific meaning. If it's styling, use CSS. üëÄ ‚ö†Ô∏è

### [A `<small>` demo](https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/OJWjomB)

# `<wbr>` and &shy

As developers, we tend to ignore some of the nice styles that print designers have tweaked in their work for years. For example, we don‚Äôt often modify kerning, leading, widow/orphan control, or hyphenation in our sites. Nor do we tend to think much about a paragraph of information that wraps onto multiple lines. Where exactly are the line breaks occurring? How do we make the rag look even?

*[8 Simple Typography Tips For Your Designs from Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/8-simple-ways-to-improve-typography-in-your-designs/)*

But the designers among us will be super happy to know that we have some control over the rag using `<wbr>`, the word break tag, and `&shy;`, the "shy" hyphen.

### What does `<wbr>` do?
Long words don't automatically hyphenate on the web. What's more, for developers trying to make text look good on the range of screen sizes we support, inevitably marketing and/or the designers will find that ONE ANNOYING SCREEN where it looks bad and harp on it endlessly. Not that we have ever personally experienced this.

    <p>Somewhere out there, on some screen, this sentence will look awful because of <dfn>sesquipedalianism</dfn>, a love of long words.</p> 
We suppose you could do some JavaScript magic to address this problem. But you know what's coming next. The content writers complain that the hyphens are in the wr-on-g spot.

<wbr> performs an essential public service in indicating where word breaks might occur as set by a human.

    <p>Somewhere out there, on some screen, this sentence will look awful because of <dfn>ses<wbr>qui<wbr>pe<wbr>dal<wbr>ian<wbr>ism</dfn>, a love of long words.</p> 
*(We may have over-<wbr>-ed in this example.)*

‚úÖ This breaks up sesquipedalianism in the right spots, and the breaks appear only if needed. See the [CodePen demo](https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/bGgYERj) for <wbr> in action.

‚õîÔ∏è The next problem is "BUT WAIT THERE IS NO HYPHEN." Correct. `<wbr>` does not provide you with a hyphen. This may be helpful for those occasions where a break is needed but a hyphen is not desired.

For example, have you ever styled a long URL on a page? (University peeps: citations, amirite?) `<wbr>` handles this well without adding extra characters. See the [CSS Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/better-line-breaks-for-long-urls/) that will walk you through this.

### What does `&shy;` do?
‚úÖ You guessed it already! A "shy" hyphen is a hyphen that appears only when needed.

    <p>Somewhere out there, on some screen, this sentence will look awful because of <dfn>ses&shy;qui&shy;pe&shy;dal&shy;ian&shy;ism</dfn>, a love of long words.</p> 

### CSS-based typography properties
HTML is for markup, so there's not much else we can do with `<wbr>` and `&shy;` in #30DaysofHTML.

However, there are many well-supported CSS properties that also control other aspects of typography. It's more than Google Fonts.

What's more, if browsers don't support these CSS properties, you are no worse off than you would be if you didn't include them. That's progressive enhancement at its finest!

- Widow/orphan control (Firefox doesn't support widows and orphans. Ponder that for a minute, you monsters.)

- CSS hyphenation (works great for English, not so great in other languages)

- CSS columns to shorten line lengths for improved reading

- CSS word breaks to prevent words from overflowing their container

- [Type scales](https://type-scale.com/) for well-proportioned type

And others!

# `<sup>` and `<sub>`

If you're a fan of footnotes, certain abbreviations, exponents, or chemical formulas, you're familiar with superscripts and subscripts. Superscripts are the ones that go up, and subscripts go down. Shockingly, these characters may be marked up in HTML using the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements.

‚ö† üëÄ As always, these HTML elements should not be used for CSS styling purposes. They are intended to communicate meaning. E=mc2 means that we‚Äôre multiplying mass x the speed of light x 2, while E=mc`<sup>`2`</sup>` means the speed of light is squared (and then multiplied by mass). Important difference.


### Superscripts with `<sup>`
Superscripts are the ones that go up. You'll find them used as exponents and some kinds of lettering, among other cases.

    <p>Which way to 4<sup>th</sup> Street?</p>  
    
    <p>The Pythagorean Theorem says that a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>.</p> 

### Subscripts with `<sub>`

Let's say we want to write some markup for Jen's favorite Valentine poem ever. 
*(Did you know she was a biology major/chemistry minor in college? Science is her love language.)*

The markup for this poem would look like this:

    <p>Roses are angiosperms<br>
     Violets are too<br>
     Sugar is C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub><br>
     We know this from peer review</p> 

### Bonus: MathML
‚úÖ You might be wondering about the boundaries between these simple HTML superscripts and subscripts and full-fledged scientific and mathematical formulas. If you're writing complex equations, you might want to look into [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML), the math markup language. It's made for long division, fractions, and of course, superscripts and subscripts, among many other elements.

### A misconception on MDN
‚õîÔ∏è MDN combines footnotes with subscripts. We have not seen this formatting often in the wild. Wikipedia likes superscripts for footnotes, as do most manuals of style.

### [`<sup>` and `<sub>` demo](https://codepen.io/erika4web/pen/zYNpogP?editors=1100)

# `<s>`, `<mark>`, `<ins>`, and `<del>`

Four elements in one day! It's a lot for one email, but there are several themes that tie these elements together.

„ÄΩÔ∏è `<mark>` draws attention to specific text. Its default styling is a yellow highlight.

ü™ß `<s>` is for strikethrough. This is designed for information which has changed, but you still want to see what was there previously. It includes a line through the text by default.

‚úîÔ∏è `<ins>` is specifically for editing, adding text to the document. It's underlined by default. Ugh.

‚ùå `<del>` is specifically for editing also, indicating that text was removed from the document. It also has a line through it by default.

Why combine these in a single day? `<s>` and `<del>` are very similar in their purpose and need further explanation. `<ins>` and `<del>` are for editing specifically. `<mark>` might be the easiest to explain, but it has similar accessibility issues to the other elements, so it makes sense to present this at the same time.

### `<mark>`: Draw attention

Sometimes you need to draw attention to certain text. That text is relevant, but perhaps not important enough to justify `<strong>` or `<em>`.

    <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Drinking too much coffee may lead to <mark>sleepless nights</mark>.</p> 
You may also use `<mark>` in a quotation (`<blockquote>` or `<q>`) to bring attention to certain parts of a passage that might not have been emphasized in the original text.

    <blockquote cite="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568302894/">
       <p><cite>Creating Killer Web Sites</cite> is the first true design book for the Web. ...you'll find this book invaluable for all aspects of design: ... <mark>why you should avoid using most standard HTML tags</mark>... </p>
       <footer>Description of <cite>Creating Killer Websites</cite> by David Siegal (1996)</footer> </blockquote> 
`<mark>` may also be used to identify search terms in a page of search results.

Other use cases are listed at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark) and [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-mark-element).

### `<s>`: Indicating information has changed
Sometimes things change. Prices increase or decrease. Tickets and featured restaurant entrees get sold out. We make silly comments and think better of them, but still want to leave the silly comment. `<s>`, the strikethrough element, is appropriate for all of these.

    <p>Purchase a ticket for <s>$100</s> <s>$50</s> $10!</p> 
In other words, **this isn't for editing**. We want you to be aware that things have changed, and that's part of the story we're telling.

### `<ins>` and `<del>`: Editing with HTML
The concept of tracking changes is found in document editors, databases, websites, and GitHub. Why not HTML? Sure, why not!

That's what `<ins>` (insertion) and `<del>` (delete) are for. These indicate permanent changes to the document. Or at least, permanent enough for now.

    <p>John's current employer is <del>Google</del> <del>Microsoft</del> <ins>Yahoo</ins>.</p> 

‚õîÔ∏è By default, browsers draw a line through deleted text (just like `<s>`) and üò† underline üò† the inserted text. Yuck. As a result, many developers use CSS to change these default stylings to a GitHub-like pale red `<del>` and pale green `<ins>`, paired with a symbol to indicate addition and subtraction of content. See [MDN's CSS pane](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ins) for an example of this (with added + and - symbols for accessibility).

### Want even better examples of these?
‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ We strongly recommend John Rhea's article at CSS Tricks, [Copyediting with Semantic HTML](https://css-tricks.com/copyediting-with-semantic-html/). Bravo!

### Why we grouped these four elements: Accessibility considerations
Even though these four elements communicate semantics, they are not necessarily recognized and read by screen readers. For example, someone using a screen reader would hear all of those prices read out loud:

    <p>Purchase a ticket for <s>$100</s> <s>$50</s> $10!</p> 
becomes, `‚ÄúPurchase a ticket for $100 $50 $10!‚Äù`

Indeed, in the MDN documentation for each element, there's a section with a similar CSS-based solution for this issue. (They vary only in the value of the content property.) For example, [here is the suggestion for `<s>` from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/s#accessibility_concerns):

    s::before, s::after {
    clip-path: inset(100%);
    clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
    height: 1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    position: absolute;
    white-space: nowrap;
    width: 1px;
    }
    s::before {
    content: " [start of stricken text] ";
    }
    s::after {
    content: " [end of stricken text] ";
    }
The first declaration visually hides the text generated by the second and third declarations, which is intended to be aural content for screen readers.

‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ We strongly recommend [Adrian Rosseli's Tweaking Text-Level Styles](https://adrianroselli.com/2017/12/tweaking-text-level-styles.html) for more detailed information about how this works.

### Commonly used attributes for `<ins>` and `<del>`
It's lovely that we know information was inserted or deleted. But when? And why? That is what the datetime and cite attributes are for.

As you might guess, *datetime* is for... time and date? But not in just any format. [Use the standardized time and date formats for HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#date_strings). This format needs an email/blog post by itself, and we'll talk about it further when we get to <time> in a few days.

We know the cite attribute is for URLs when used with `<blockquote>` or `<q>` (Day 3), but what about `<ins>` and `<del>`? Fortunately, it's the same. Specify a URL where you might track bugs or other changes where someone might get a more detailed explanation about the change.

    <p>John's current employer is 
    <del datetime="2015-06-01" cite="https://www.example.com/resume.html">Google</del>  
    <del cite="https://www.example.com/resume.html"  datetime="2017-01-08">Microsoft</del>  
    <ins cite="https://www.example.com/resume.html"  datetime="2020-03-06">Yahoo</ins>.</p> 
Once again, because *cite* and *datetime* are attributes, neither is displayed on the website by default, either overtly or as a tooltip. You might use CSS or JavaScript to expose these if desired. Also, even though our example uses both attributes together, you may use them individually.

### [`<mark>`, `<s>`, `<ins>` and `<del>` demo](https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/KKaQdgM?editors=1010)

# `<code>` and `<pre>`

If you want your code to star on the page instead of behind the scenes, then hitch your wagon to the `<code>` and `<pre>` tags.

By default, your browser will ignore any white space between tags, and condense any white space in text into a single space. This is useful for code, poetry, and code poetry.

    <p>   
    An amoeba named Max and his brother
         Were sharing a drink with each other;
    In the midst of their quaffing,
         They split themselves laughing,
    And each of them now is a mother. 
    </p> 
Even if we were to add <br> tags at the end of each line, [an appropriate use of the break tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br), the zig-zaggy tabbing effect would be gone.

### `<pre>` for pre-formatted text
If we want to preserve white space, then wrapping our content in `<pre>` keeps the formatting -- that includes blank lines, tabs and more than one space in a line.

`<pre>` is useful for displaying:

üíª computer code where the spacing is important

üìß written communication with specific white space formatting, like an email, poem or letter

üé® all of your totally rad ASCII art

    <pre>
              .,-;-;-,. /'_\
            _/_/_/_|_\_\) /
          '-<_><_><_><_>=/\
     jgs    `/_/====/_/-'\_\
             ""     ""    "" 
    </pre> 

### Accessibility and images
You know about the importance of alt attributes with images. This provides a text-based description of the image. So what happens when we have ASCII art in a `<pre>` element? Well, we still need a text equivalent. MDN suggests using the `<figure>` element for this. (We'll discuss `<figure>` in the Multimedia Extravaganza unit towards the end of the month.)

    <figure role="img" aria-labelledby="turtle-caption">
    <pre>
              .,-;-;-,. /'_\
            _/_/_/_|_\_\) /
          '-<_><_><_><_>=/\
     jgs    `/_/====/_/-'\_\
             ""     ""    "" 
    </pre>  
    <figcaption id="turtle-caption">
           The raddest baddest turtle ever seen in ASCII art.
    </figcaption> 
    </figure> 

### `<code>` for inline code
The more semantic `<code>` element can be used in two ways. First, use it inline within other lines of text:

    <p><code>turtle</code> is a Python library that enables users to command a turtle to draw pictures on a virtual canvas. We can use functions like <code>turtle.forward()</code> and <code>turtle.right</code> which can move the turtle around.</p> 
If you have multiple lines of code to display, `<code>` may be nested in `<pre>`:

    <pre>
     <code>
     # Python Turtle program to draw star
     import turtle
     star = turtle.Turtle()
     for i in range(50):
         star.forward(50)
         star.right(144)
     turtle.done() 
     </code>
    </pre> 
By default, both of these tags are rendered in your browser in a monospace font, meaning each character takes up the same width on the screen. This is how code is usually displayed, so you can just leave it as is, or adjust using CSS, depending on your content.

### We‚Äôre running a little long
üëÄ If your `<pre>` content lines are long, you might run into an issue with the content being cut off in narrow views. [Example 4 in the CodePen demo](https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/PoWQpKp) models these options.

### Option 1: Do nothing
The content will get cut off if the window is too narrow.

### Option 2: Wrap the content
CSS-Tricks points out that we could add:

    pre { white-space: pre-wrap; }
Pre-wrap will wrap the content and helpfully preserves pre-formatted whitespace.

### Option 3: Add a scrollbar
Or alternatively, allow content to be accessed by a horizontal scrollbar:

    pre { overflow-x: auto; }
For more helpful tips for formatting wide content, including an easy way to add color formatting to your code snippets using a lightweight JS library called [Prism](https://prismjs.com/), see CSS-Trick's [Considerations for Styling the pre Tag](https://css-tricks.com/considerations-styling-pre-tag/).

### An interesting attribute
If your `<code>` contains computer code, there isn't a readily available attribute to indicate the coding language. The main recommendation, encouraged by WHATWG, but not mentioned by MDN, is to use a class with a prefix of "language-".
    
    <pre>
     <code class="language-python">
     # Python Turtle program to draw a Rainbow Benzene
     import turtle
     colors = ['red', 'purple', 'blue', 'green', 'orange', 'yellow']
     t = turtle.Pen()
     turtle.bgcolor('black')
     for x in range(360):
         t.pencolor(colors[x%6])
         t.width(x/100 + 1)
         t.forward(x)
         t.left(59) 
     </code>
    </pre> 
Erika thinks this goes against what CSS is used for, unless your Python code happens to be styled differently than your JavaScript code on the page. Erika would be more likely to use a data element as in `<pre data-language="python">` because most screen readers will read out the text of a `data-` attribute. If you have insights on this, [please comment in the discussion](https://jen4web.substack.com/p/code/comments).

### [`<code>` and `<pre>` demo](https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/PoWQpKp)

# `<kbd>` and `<samp>`

Yesterday we talked about displaying your code and other pre-formatted text on the website using `<code>` and `<pre>`. Today, we're all about the documentation - what happens when someone runs your code? What do they press on the keyboard or say via voice interface, and what is the output?

### `<kbd>`: Program Input

If there are keys to be pressed on the keyboard, or commands to be said by voice, they should be marked up. There's a few ways of doing this, though.

### Keys marked up individually
    <p>Windows users will use the keyboard shortcuts using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>,  
    while Mac users will use  <kbd>Command</kbd> instead.</p> 
Pretty straightforward. You can also use this same markup if the keys are to be pressed together:

    <p>On Windows, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy.</p> 
However, if you check [today‚Äôs CodePen demo](https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/MWJQmZK), you‚Äôll see that the + may look a bit different than the Ctrl and C above. That‚Äôs because via browser default styling, `<kbd>` uses a monospace font. It‚Äôs likely the rest of that paragraph does not, so you‚Äôll see differences in size and styling.

### Grouping keys
You may also group keys together in a unit. This fixes that styling problem mentioned above, and it may better communicate that the keys are pressed as a unit.

    <p>On Windows, press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd></kbd> to copy.</p> 

### Voice commands
They're more and more common these days. If you have a voice command, you can mark that up with `<kbd>` too, since that is your interface with the device.

    <p>Just say <kbd>Alexa, what's the weather like?</kbd> to get a weather report for your area.</p>  

### `<samp>`: What did the computer say?
When reporting computer-generated messages, use the `<samp>` element.

    <p>I tried to install WordPress, but the screen said <samp>500 Internal Server Error</samp>.</p> 

### Combining elements

ü•™ It may also be helpful to combine several of these elements while writing documentation. Both `<code>` and `<samp>` in the below example will render within the `<pre>` box. In this case, we're looking at our code plus the output generated from that code.

    <pre>
       <code class="language-javascript">
          console.log("Hello, world!");
       </code>
       <samp>
          Hello, world!
       </samp> 
    </pre>

### Like peanut butter and jelly

ü•™ `<kbd>` and `<samp>` go together like peanut butter and jelly ‚Äî they were made for each other. [CSS-Tricks has a great article on how these elements work together](https://css-tricks.com/html-elements-unite-the-voltron-like-powers-of-combining-elements/#keyboard-sample-and-variable), as well as other hard-working element teams (like `<abbr>` and `<dfn>`, or `<cite>` and `<blockquote>`, covered earlier).

### [`<kbd>` and `<samp>` demo](https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/MWJQmZK)


# `<var>`

If you are referencing math or programming, or writing out a math equation, the variables in those expressions can be wrapped in a `<var>` element.

The browser will often render the variable as italicized by default, but like with many things on the web, it depends.

### Examples using `<var>`
‚úÖ <var> is useful when you are discussing your programming:

    <pre>
      <code>
        for(let i = 0; i<10; i++) {
          console.log(i); 
        }
      </code>
    </pre>  
    <p>This code loops over an index position, <var>i</var>, and prints out
    all of the numbers from 0 to 9.</p> 
‚úÖ Or when writing out a simple math formula:

    <p>The area of a circle can be found by multiplying pi times the radius
    squared, which we can write as œÄ<var>r</var><sup>2</sup></p> 
‚ùìNot much is written about <var>. It really is a simple element! But our feeling is that it can be used in conjunction with `<code>`, `<pre>`, `<kbd>` and `<samp>` as needed.

### Reminder about writing math
If you need to write out a lot of math, like you're Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting, then WHATWG and MDN both suggest considering the [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) standard, which is essentially special XML tags for math equations.

### [`<var>` demo](https://codepen.io/erika4web/pen/gOgewqm?editors=1000)

# `<time>` `<time>` `<time>`

‚úÖ `<time>` identifies 24-hour clock times, as well as Gregorian calendar dates. It may also be used for a time duration.

‚õîÔ∏è Time has many confusing formats across programming languages and other standards. That's where all of the potential issues are, not in the HTML itself.

There are no fewer than [58 examples of how `<time>` might be formatted in the WHATWG documentation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element).

### `<time>` in the HTML sense
‚úÖ `<time>` indicates where time is occurring in your text, including dates, times, and durations.

Let's identify the time elements in this paragraph of text:

    <p>The last in-person conference I attended was ConFoo in Montreal,
    Canada. It was held <time>February 26</time> to <time>February 28, 
    2020</time>. There were at least <time>7 1/2 hours</time> of sessions 
    each day. I flew home on <time>Saturday at 1:03PM</time>.</p> 
While these time cues are understandable to humans, they are not machine-readable. The above paragraph would fail validation for this reason.

‚ö†Ô∏è Either the text in between the `<time>` tags must be machine-readable as defined in the spec, or we'd need to use the datetime attribute. And let's be honest - no humans want to read machine-readable formats, so it‚Äôs all about datetime.

    <p>The last in-person conference I attended was ConFoo in Montreal, 
    Canada. It was held <time datetime="2020-02-26">February 26</time> to 
    <time datetime="2020-02-28">February 28, 2020</time>. There were at 
    least <time datetime="PT7H30M">7 1/2 hours</time> of sessions each day. 
    I flew home on <time datetime="2020-02-29T13:03">Saturday</time>.</p> 

### Formatting common time
The following formats may be used as content in `<time>` or as the value of a datetime attribute.

- **Year-month-day**. Year or day are optional.

- **Hour:minute:seconds**. Seconds are optional and may include a decimal.

- **Year-month-day hour:minute:seconds** OR **Year-month-dayThour:minute:seconds**. There must be either a T or a space between the date and the time for machine parsing.

### Other types of time to format
[Look them up if you need them.](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element)

- Time zones and time zone offsets

- Global date and time strings

- Week numbers (like 2021-W17)

- A duration string (like 8h, or 2h 12m 16s, or PT2H12M16S)

### Other uses of time
Don't confuse `<time>` with three possible `<form>` inputs and two elements:

- `<input type="time">`, specifically for hours and minutes (seconds optional)

- `<input type="date">`, specifically for year-month-day

- `<input type="datetime-local">`, specifying a date and a time in a single input.

- `<ins>` and `<del>`, as discussed recently, also use the datetime attribute.

All of the above elements use the same date and time formatting used for `<time>` and *datetime* as values.
