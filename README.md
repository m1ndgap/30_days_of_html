#`<address>`

###What does `<address>` do?
`<address>` should be used for addresses. You guessed that already. But what kind of addresses, and in what context?

Address context
`<address>` was originally used to indicate contact information for the page owner. It has since evolved to include any type of contact information, generally the address of an article author or the address of a website.

- 🔹 If `<address>` is placed within an `<article>`, it is assumed this is the article author's address.

- 🔸 If `<address>` is placed closest to the `<body>` tag, it's assumed to be the website organization's address. Usually this type of information is found in a page `<header>` or   `<footer>`.

### Kinds of addresses

✅ Any information that's used to contact the website organization or the article author is fair game. That might include:

- email addresses

- social media links

- phone numbers

The contact person's name may also be included in an address element.

⛔️ However, non-contact information is to be avoided.
